# Delivery Fee Calculator
react native/ expo delivery fee calculator 

## Description
This application can be test directly in mobile devices by using [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/).

### Requirements

* node
* npm
* git
* expo-cli

#### 1 Clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Codefeak/deliveryFeeCalculator.git
```

#### 2 Install dependencies
```bash
expo install
```
or
```bash
npm install
```
#### 3 Compile and serve
Run the command below in a terminal to run the project 
```bash
expo start
```
A metro bundler will automatically open in your default browser.The left side bar also allows you to choose different options like
* run on Android devices/emulator
* run on ios simulator
* run in web
* email weblink
* production/development mode
* connections (tunnel/LAN/Local)

However, it is not necessary to choose any since there is a QR code available at the bottom and you can scan that QR code via any mobile devices and run the application on it. QR code can be scanned with Expo Go app in respective devices so installation of Expo Go app in mobile device is essential. You can find a link [here](https://expo.dev/client)

#### Expo Go app for Android and iOS
The fastest way to get up and running is to use the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device. Expo Go allows you to open up apps that are being served through Expo CLI.

* [Andriod Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
* [iOS App Store](https://itunes.com/apps/exponent)

When the Expo Go app is finished installing, open it up. If you created an account with expo-cli then you can sign in here on the "Profile" tab. This will make it easier for you to open projects in the client when you have them open in development â€” they will appear automatically in the "Projects" tab of the client app.

### Running test
```bash
npm test
```
